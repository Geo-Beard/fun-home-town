      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Geo-Beard and this is my first, fully armed and operational, website!</p>
        <p>I've been tasked with creating this site using my newly learned skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>I'm a geologist by training so I've decided to share some of my favourite places I've been over the years, plus some facts about them. Hopefully you'll learn a few things about geology!</p>

      <h2>What is geology?</h2>
        <p><em>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology" target="_blank">Geology</a> is a branch of natural science concerned with Earth and other astronomical objects, the features or rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time." - Wikipedia</em></p>

        <p>I thought about putting a lot of technical figures in this section. However, I decided to provide an external link to the wikipedia page on geology and put in a pretty picture instead. If you'd like to know more feel free to contact me!</p>

      <h2>Places I've been as a geologist</h2>
      <p>In this section I'll provide a rundown of all of the places I've been as part of my studies and professional life. It's not particularly interesting but it's quite a good way of looking back at where I've been and when - plus using lists in HTML.</p>
