      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Geo-Beard and this is my first, fully armed and operational, website!</p>
        <p>I've been tasked with creating this site using my newly learned skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>I'm a geologist by training so I've decided to share some of my favourite places I've been over the years, plus some facts about them. Hopefully you'll learn a few things about geology!</p>
